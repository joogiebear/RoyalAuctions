# RoyalAuctions

A Hypixel-style Auction House for Paper, built to work properly with the **eco suite**
(EcoItems, EcoArmor, Talismans, Reforges, EcoPets, EcoScrolls, StatTrackers) — and to work
just as well on a server that has none of them.

Part of a suite with [RoyalBank](https://github.com/joogiebear/RoyalBank),
[RoyalBazaar](https://github.com/joogiebear/RoyalBazaar) and
[EconGuard](https://github.com/joogiebear/EconGuard).

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **Server** | Paper 1.21+ (tested on Paper 26.2 / Java 25) |
| **Required** | Vault **and an economy provider** (EssentialsX, CMI, an EcoBits currency with `vault: true`, …) |
| **Optional** | eco suite, PlaceholderAPI, EconGuard, Citizens |

The eco suite is entirely optional. Without it you lose custom-item categorisation and the tier
filter; everything else works, and the plugin never touches an eco class.

## Install

1. Drop `RoyalAuctions.jar` into `plugins/`.
2. Start the server. Configs generate on first run.
3. `/ah` — done.

JDBC drivers and HikariCP are downloaded at runtime by Paper's library loader; nothing is shaded.

---

## Commands

Base command `/auctionhouse`, aliases **`/ah`**, `/auctions`, `/auction`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/ah` | Open the **hub** — Auction Browser, View Bids, Manage Auctions |
| `/ah browse` | Straight to the browser |
| `/ah bids` | Auctions you have bid on ("top bidder on X of Y") |
| `/ah sell` *(or `create`)* | Create-auction flow |
| `/ah search <query>` | Search listings by name |
| `/ah listings` | Manage your own listings |
| `/ah collect` | Claim purchases and returned items |
| `/ah <username>` | View that player's active auctions |
| `/ah category` | **Admin.** Inspect the held item: category, *which rule matched*, and tier |
| `/ah reload` | **Admin.** Reload config, categories, menus, rarities |

## Permissions

| Node | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `royalauctions.use` | `true` | Open and browse |
| `royalauctions.sell` | `true` | List items |
| `royalauctions.admin` | `op` | `/ah reload`, `/ah category` |

> NPCs run commands **as the clicking player**, so they inherit that player's permissions. If you
> restrict `royalauctions.use`, a player without it clicking the NPC gets nothing — that's expected.

## Menus

Every screen is a file in `gui/`, authored in the **EcoMenus dialect** — the same shape you already
know from EcoMenus/EcoShop.

```yaml
title: "&8Auction Browser"
rows: 6

mask:
  items:
    - red_stained_glass_pane      # 1
    - black_stained_glass_pane    # 2
  pattern:
    - "A10000000"                 # digits = mask.items filler
    - "A20000000"                 # 0 / letters = named dynamic regions
    - "A67777777"

regions:
  category-slots: "A"             # column 1: the category buttons
  content-slots: "0"              # the listing grid

slots:
  - id: sort
    item: 'hopper name:"&eSort: &f%sort%"'
    lore:
      - "&7Click to change sorting."
    location:                     # 1-based row/column, not raw slot indexes
      row: 6
      column: 6
    left-click:
      - id: ah_sort
```

Files: `hub`, `browse`, `bids`, `seller`, `manage`, `collection`, `create`, `duration`,
`bid`, `confirm-purchase`, `confirm-auction`, `confirm-bid`, `confirm-cancel`.

**Two extensions over stock EcoMenus:**

- **Named mask regions** — one menu can have several dynamic areas (`content-slots` *and*
  `category-slots`), not just one.
- **Per-click actions** — `left-click:` and `right-click:` can do *different* things. A button with
  no `right-click:` behaves the same on both, so nothing changes for buttons that don't care.

**List placeholders.** A lore line that is *exactly* `%tier_list%` (or `%type_list%`) expands into
**one line per option**, with the current one marked — that's how the filter buttons show their
whole list rather than just the current value:

```yaml
  - id: tier
    item: 'nether_star hide_attributes name:"&eItem Tier"'
    lore:
      - "&7Filter listings by item tier."
      - ""
      - "%tier_list%"             # -> "> EPIC" for current, dimmed for the rest
      - ""
      - "&eLeft-click &7to go up"
      - "&eRight-click &7to go down"
    left-click:
      - id: ah_tier_prev
    right-click:
      - id: ah_tier_next          # swap these two to reverse the direction
```

**Effect ids:** `ah_hub` `ah_browse` `ah_bids` `ah_manage` `ah_collection` `ah_create` `ah_search`
`ah_sort` `ah_tier_prev` `ah_tier_next` `ah_type_prev` `ah_type_next` `ah_clear_filters`
`ah_prev_page` `ah_next_page` `ah_set_price` `ah_set_duration` `ah_toggle_type` `ah_remove_item`
`ah_continue` `ah_confirm` `ah_confirm_purchase` `ah_confirm_bid` `ah_confirm_cancel` `ah_bid_min`
`ah_bid_custom` `ah_back` `ah_cancel` `close_inventory`

> ⚠️ **YAML gotcha:** an inline item spec containing a **colon followed by a space** must be quoted,
> or SnakeYAML reads it as a mapping and the file fails to load:
> ```yaml
> item: 'hopper name:"&eSort: &f%sort%"'    # quoted — correct
> item: hopper name:"&eSort: &f%sort%"      # BREAKS the file
> ```

## Categories

One file per category in `categories/`. **The file name is the category id**, so
`categories/weapons.yml` defines `weapons`. Add a category by dropping in a file; remove it by
deleting the file. Column 1 of the browser is ordered by each file's `priority` (lowest first).

```yaml
# categories/weapons.yml
display-name: "&cWeapons"
icon: DIAMOND_SWORD
priority: 10

match:
  items:                                  # exact pins - see below
    - "ecoitems:brazen_sword"
    - "minecraft:trident"
  eco-namespaces: ["ecoarmor"]            # a whole eco plugin -> one category
  material-suffixes: ["_SWORD", "_AXE"]
  materials: ["BOW", "CROSSBOW"]
  material-prefixes: []
  tags: ["WEAPON"]                        # EDIBLE BLOCK ARMOR TOOL WEAPON
  any: false                              # the catch-all
```

**Exactly one category must be the catch-all** (`any: true`, highest `priority` number) or items
matching nothing would have nowhere to go. That's `tools_misc.yml` by default.

### How an item's category is decided

Most rules **infer** a category from the item's **base material** — which is only ever a *guess* for
a custom item. A custom dagger built on a `STICK` would land in Misc. So:

1. **`match.items:`** — an exact pin. Accepts eco ids *and* vanilla (`minecraft:trident`).
   **Beats every other rule, in any category, at any priority.** This is the escape hatch.
2. `match.eco-namespaces:` — a whole eco plugin maps to one category.
3. `materials` / suffixes / prefixes / `tags` — inference from the base material.
4. `any: true` — the catch-all.

### Two tools so none of this is a black box

- **`/ah category`** (holding an item) prints the item key, where it lands, **which rule decided
  it**, and its tier.
- **A startup audit** logs every eco item that only hit the catch-all:

  ```
  [RoyalAuctions] Category audit: 24 of 141 eco item(s) fell through to 'tools_misc'.
                  Pin them under a category's match.items: if they belong elsewhere:
                    - ecoitems:enchanted_diamond
                    - stattrackers:arrows_shot
                    ...
  ```

  This tells you **exactly** which items are worth pinning, instead of leaving you to enumerate
  every material in the game. When everything resolves it prints
  `Category audit: all 124 eco items resolved to a category.`

### Zero-inference mode

```yaml
category-options:
  strict-items: true    # ONLY items pinned via match.items: get a category.
                        # Everything else goes to the catch-all. No guessing at all.
```

### Renaming a category

Category is stamped on a listing when it's created, so renaming one would strand every existing
listing under an id no button matches. RoyalAuctions **re-derives and persists** those on load
instead:

```
[RoyalAuctions] Re-categorised 3 listing(s) whose category no longer exists.
```

Migrating from an older version with an inline `categories:` block in `config.yml`? It's split into
`categories/*.yml` automatically on first start, and the plugin tells you the old block can be
deleted.

---

## Item tiers

**Tiers are eco's rarities.** They're read straight from `plugins/EcoItems/rarities/`.

The important part — and it isn't obvious — is that **EcoItems' `rarities/` folder is the rarity
registry for the *whole* eco suite, not just EcoItems.** Each rarity file has an `items:` list that
can claim items from **any** eco namespace:

```yaml
# plugins/EcoItems/rarities/rare.yml
lore:
  - "&9&lRARE"
weight: 3
items:
  - ecoitems:enchanted_diamond
  - talismans:starter_talisman
  - reforges:stone_sharp
  - ecoarmor:set_miner_helmet
  - ecopets:frog_spawn_egg
  - ecoscrolls:scroll_hot_potato_book
```

So there is **no per-plugin mapping config**, and RoyalAuctions never compiles against a paid
plugin. Whatever rarity an item shows in-game is exactly what the tier filter sorts by — one source
of truth, no drift. Add a rarity file, and it becomes filterable.

An item's rarity comes from either a rarity's `items:` list **or** an EcoItems item's own `rarity:`
field. If several rarities claim an item, the **highest `weight` wins** (that's why `none` ships with
weight 100).

Tiers are discovered automatically. `config.yml` only *curates* the filter:

```yaml
tiers:
  enabled: true
  order:                  # cycle order; discovered rarities not listed are appended
    - common
    - uncommon
    - rare
    - epic
    - legendary
    - mythic
  hide: []                # rarities to leave out of the filter entirely
  icons:
    epic: PURPLE_DYE
```

The tier is resolved **once, when the listing is created**, and stored on the row — browsing never
recomputes it. Listings created before this version have no tier and appear only under *No Filter*.

Without EcoItems installed, the tier filter simply reports `0 tiers` and sits inert.

---

## Confirmations

Buy-It-Now and Create always had a confirm screen. Bids and cancellations did **not** — and both
move real value on a single click (a bid takes the money immediately and holds it until you're
outbid or the auction ends). Both are now gated, including the *typed* bid amount, which is exactly
where you'd fat-finger an extra zero.

```yaml
confirmations:
  bid: true
  cancel: true
  purchase: true
```

Set one to `false` and the code falls **straight through** to the action — no screen is rendered, so
you pay nothing for the feature.

---

## Storage

```yaml
storage:
  type: SQLITE            # or MYSQL for a network / shared setup
  sqlite-file: auctions.db
  mysql:
    host: localhost
    port: 3306
    database: royalauctions
    username: root
    password: ""
    properties: "useSSL=false&characterEncoding=utf8&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true"
    pool-size: 10
```

HikariCP over JDBC. Tables: `ra_listings`, `ra_collection`, `ra_bids`.

Items are stored with Paper's `serializeAsBytes()`, which preserves the **full** NBT/component data
— so eco custom items survive a listing intact with no per-plugin code, and even survive the eco
plugin being uninstalled.

> **`ra_bids` is new.** The listing row only ever stored the *current* top bidder, so once you were
> outbid there was no record you had ever bid — which made "auctions I've bid on" unknowable. Every
> bid is now recorded. It is **not backfillable**: only bids placed from this version on appear in
> View Bids.

## PlaceholderAPI

Registered under the `royalauctions` identifier (auto-registers when PlaceholderAPI is present).

## NPCs (Citizens)

`/ah` takes no arguments, so an NPC just runs it:

```
/npc create Auctioneer
/npc command add ah
/npc command cooldown 2
```

The command **must run as the player** (Citizens' default — `player: true`). `/ah` is player-only, so
an NPC set to run it as console will just print "player only".

---

## Building

```bash
mvn -DskipTests package     # -> target/RoyalAuctions.jar
```

Java 21, Maven. `eco` is a `provided` dependency resolved from the Auxilor repo. Versioning is
`year.week.revision` (e.g. `2026.28.1`), matching the eco suite's numbering.

---

## Gotchas

- **Paper 26.2 requires Java 25** to *run*, even though the plugin targets Java 21 bytecode.
- **A running JVM keeps old plugin classes** even after you replace the jar — fully stop the server
  before testing a new build.
- **EcoItems' lookup namespace is `ecoitems:` (plural)**, not `ecoitem:`.
- **Vanilla item ids** (`minecraft:diamond`) are resolved via Bukkit, not eco — eco's lookup doesn't
  reliably handle the `minecraft:` namespace.
- The plugin **waits** for a Vault economy provider rather than disabling if one isn't registered
  when it enables. Vault being a hard dependency says nothing about the *economy plugin*, which is
  separate and can register later; disabling would mean the plugin silently kills itself purely
  because of plugin load order.
