# RoyalAuctions

A Hypixel-style Auction House for Paper, built to be **fully compatible with the eco suite**
(EcoItems, Talismans, Reforges, EcoArmor, and any other `eco`-based custom item).

Part of the Mystipixel plugin family alongside **RoyalBank** (banking) and **EconGuard**
(economy anti-abuse). Sales flow through Vault, so EconGuard sees them as normal economy activity.

## Features

- **Category tabs** (Hypixel-style) — Weapons, Armor, Tools, Talismans, Reforge Stones,
  Enchanted Books, Consumables, Blocks, Miscellaneous. Fully configurable in `config.yml`.
- **Search** by item name (click the search button and type in chat, or `/ah search <query>`).
- **Sorting** — Newest, Oldest, Price ↑, Price ↓.
- **Full item fidelity** — listings are stored with Paper's native item serialization, so all
  eco custom data (NBT / components / persistent data) survives listing → purchase intact.
- **Listing fees** — configurable percent-of-price with a minimum floor, charged on posting.
- **Collection** — purchases that don't fit, plus expired/cancelled listings, wait safely in
  `/ah collect`.
- **Expiry** — listings auto-expire after a configurable duration and return to the seller.
- **Storage** — SQLite by default (zero setup), MySQL for multi-server networks. Chosen in config.
- **PlaceholderAPI** support.

## Categories

Items are tested against each category in ascending `priority` and placed in the first that
matches. A rule matches if **any** of its predicate types matches:

- `eco-namespaces` — eco source plugin, e.g. `[talismans]`, `[reforges]`, `[ecoarmor]`
- `materials` — exact Bukkit material names
- `material-suffixes` / `material-prefixes` — e.g. `_SWORD`, `_HELMET`
- `tags` — built-ins: `EDIBLE`, `BLOCK`, `ARMOR`, `TOOL`, `WEAPON`
- `any: true` — catch-all (keep one, e.g. `misc`, as the final fallback)

## Building

Requires the `eco` API in your local Maven repo (installed from the server jar):

```bash
mvn install:install-file \
  -Dfile=/path/to/plugins/eco-2026.28-polymart.jar \
  -DgroupId=com.willfp -DartifactId=eco -Dversion=2026.28 -Dpackaging=jar

mvn -DskipTests package
```

The JDBC driver and connection pool are downloaded at runtime by Paper's library loader,
so the output jar stays small.

## Requirements

- Paper (tested on MC 26.2)
- Vault + an economy provider
- Optional: eco (for custom-item categories), PlaceholderAPI, EconGuard
